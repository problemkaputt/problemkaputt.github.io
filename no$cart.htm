This DOS based tool converts CPC disk images (.DSK files) into CPC Plus/KX 4000
cartridges (.CPR files). And thus allows to play most CPC games on diskless
CPC 464+ computers, and (as far as fully joystick controlled) even on the
KX 4000 games console.
<P>
The program copies the CPC 6128 operating system ROMs and the disk image into
a cartridge, patches the AMSDOS Read Sector function, and other than that
there isn't much behind it.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> I if anybody should ever test this program with real hardware,
or if anybody is looking for a new home for his old CPC 6128+ or KX 4000 :-),
please let me know! I don't own such a computer, so I couldn't actually test
if no$cart works in reality...
