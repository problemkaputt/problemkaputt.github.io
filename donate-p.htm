Nocash Project Donations
<P>
<HR>
Here you can donate something to support the no$xxx projects.
Some small amount like $2 or $3 would be nice. More would be wonderful.
And less is also possible (though amounts below 50 cents would be a bit
pointless, as paypal would keep most or all of it as transaction fee).
<P>
The money is mostly used to get the rent paid for my two rooms,
and to eat and drink something.
My actual software development expenses are near zero,
but, even trivial expenses on food can become quite ruinously
when wasting some months or years on fulltime software projects.
If you like the no$projects - your donations would <B>really help</B> me to keep wasting my time on those things.
