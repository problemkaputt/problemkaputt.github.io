Yup, that's my <I>current</I> address, this webpage is <I>guaranteed</I> to
be updated if I should move to a new headquarter.

OK, here's my mailing address. Monetary donations (cash or cheque) are very
welcome and will allow & motivate me to continue, questions like <I>"I want
to play games, but don't know how?"</I> will only keep me away from programming.

 <B>No questions about no$gmb/gba!</B><BR>
 I know that computers often show up with various problems that might be
 very frustating for beginners (and experienced users). In any case:
 Don't ask me. I really don't have the time to reply.

Just to be sure, that is a complete valid german address, there are no
additional ZIP codes required. Note: My <B>old address</B> (at Ringheide)
still works either, but mail send to that address may get delayed by a couple
of weeks.
