The Reason for writing an own debugger was that the stupid Bordland TD
debugger sucks memory. It is impossible to load the debugger and a
large-file-to-debug at the same time. Bingo.<BR>
Surely, the DOS debuggers would work, but they never included 286+ commands
and window-orientated surfaces...<P>
So, Hack was born.<P>
<P>Features:<P>
* TD-like window surface, but no TD-like bugs.<BR>
* 80286- and most 80386-commands supported (assembler / disassembler).<BR>
* Only 30K RAM required.<BR>
* NU-like hexdump editor.<BR>
* Better Search / Continue Search functions<BR>
* Follow Jump / Undo Follow Function (Cursor left / right)<BR>
<P>Language: 100% Assembler. Category: Cracker's best friend. Year: 1994-1995.
