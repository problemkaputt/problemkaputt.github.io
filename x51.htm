<B>NO$X51 - AMT630A Emulator/Debugger</B><BR>
This project started back in 2001, at that time it's been emulating
80C31/80C51/P8xCE558 single-chip 8-bit microcontrollers, which didn't have
too much pratical use as it didn't emulate whatever peripherals
(like tape decks, washing machines, servo motors, temperature sensors, etc.).<BR>
As of 2018 it turned into a fully fledged AMT630A emulator with 320x240 pixel
TFT video, and standard 3KEY keypad input, allowing to create/debug AMT630A
software...
<P>
<B>Features</B><BR>
The program includes CPU-emulation, assembler, disassembler, debugger,
eeprom upload function, this wonderful package can be downloaded.<BR>

<B>Chip Specifications</B><BR>
Just for curiosity, here are standalone versions of the specs (extracted from
the help text/manual which is built-in into the emulator/debugger).<BR>

<P>
<B>The XED Editor (separately required for DOS version only)</B><BR>
The no$x51 built-in source code assembler is parts of able to communicate with
my XED editor (download <A HREF="xed.zip">here</A>). That is, access the editor
by hitting ALT+E from inside of no$x51, edit your source code, hit F9 in the
editor, this will assemble your program and, if no errors occured, autostart
it in the emulator, otherwise, in case of assembly errors it'll switch back to
the editor, and automatically move it to the first error-line.<BR>
Installation notes: Copy XED into a directory which is part of your PATH
(eg. your C:\Windows directory, if you are using windows), and select XED
as preferred editor in no$x51 setup!<BR>
