<HR>
This program executes a program as DOS program instead as Windows program.
(Got that? Maybe repeated the program-word a bit too many times, sorry!)
<P>
The windows executable format contains two entry points, one pointing to
the actual windows program, and one pointing to a DOS program, which are
both included in the executable file. In most cases the DOS entry point
refers to a short procedure (stub) that outputs a short message like
"This program must be run under Win32" and exits.
<P>
However, a few programs might include both fully functional DOS and Windows
programs in the same executable. That isn't necessarily very user-friendly
because it makes the exefile twice as large as required. And when started in
a DOS box (ie. with windows loaded) it'll automatically execute the windows
version of the program, even though the user might have desired to run the
(possibly superior) DOS version.
<P>
In most cases it'll only display the stub-message (which might be eventually
useful for programmers whom want to test their stubs) and in a few cases it
might unlock access to a fully featured DOS program. The only program that I
know about would be MFT.EXE (quarterdecks fine diagnostics tool that is
included in the QEMM package).
