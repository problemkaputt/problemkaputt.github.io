This mini program resets your computer. (Identically to the <B>Ctrl-Alt-Del</B>
key combination.)
<P>
Well, it's really a very simple program, possibly not even worth to be
called a program, but I kept using it for some years now, and treat it
as a quite useful thing, so why not uploading and making it public?
Maybe it'll be of some use for somebody else also...
<P>
Sometimes it might be more comfortable to type "reset" at the DOS prompt,
rather than using the reset key combination. And beside for that, the
program might turn out useful in batch files. (For example, if you have a
batch file that exchanges your AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or CONFIG.SYS files, and
want the computer to reboot automatically after exchanging the files,)
When using reset in windows DOS boxes, this will close the DOS box.
