Note: It isn't that bad all the time, only a handful of people sending that
kind of mails, and it might be well illustrating why no$gba is not available
for gaming purposes. No, no, I don't mean to say that all gamers are like that,
but many are.
Explained again, the freeware version for hobby programmers is freeware, it
does not cost any money. The full version for professional developers has been
written for companies only, I did not, and do not intend to receive any money
from gamers.

There are better GBA emulators than yours..
VisualBoyAdvance (the better, http://vboy.emuhq.com, *FREE* and plays
commercial roms)(in fact, i have 5 roms of REAL GBA Games.
BoycottAdvance (poor, but better, i don't remeber the site).

Think that.
The real GBA costs only $ 100 and a game costs 40-60$
YOUR FUCKIN' EMULATOR COSTS $2000 and is only for companies.
The companies doesn't use emulators to work better

A goood GBA emulator (emu) is free and the roms ... you can download it
from irc chat servers...

PS:

&lt;quote&gt; What a stupidity!
Hello to the no$gba protection
Below describes how the protection stuff works...
&lt;/quote&gt;
The protection of the public cutdown/freeware version
This version is made for hobby programmers, (only for you?) I've tried
to keep the program as functional as possible (yeah, BAH!) (for small
games only, but with complete debugging features), and to make it
useless (I don't think that...) for crackers & gamers:

  1) Cartridge/ROM emulation program code is missing in both versions.
  2) Sound emulation program code missing in color version.
  3) Color emulation program code missing in sound version.
&lt;quote&gt;Second stupidity!
Any attempts to upgrade the public cutdown/freeware version into a fully
functional (or only parts of more functional) version will result in
discontinuing the free public version completely and forever. (forever,
huh?)
(Note! Visit the cracker's networks on the net, they are full with
crackers that they want to &lt;h1&gt;CRACK&lt;/h1&gt; your &lt;h1&gt;fucking program&lt;/h1&gt;)
&lt;/quote&gt;
The protection of the professional full/commercial version (duh!)
This is for developers/companies only (third stupidity, the companies
doesn't want to use emus for work). Yes, it is commercial. Yes, I call
myself nocash(what computer do you use? A 486 with win95? Or a 386 with
win31+win32s?). Bet what? I need some money like everybody else (yeah,
right. Better you can sole the Queen's jewels). No, I don't care for
luxuries(a new 486 dx4 w/16 m o' RAM. Sucker!).

  1) The program is shipped in form of an encrypted data file.(yeah, you
use PGP)
  2) The data file is completely useless without decryption
program.(again, DUH!)
  3) The decrypter translates the data file into exe file.(pgp by
nocazh)
  4) The program will not work without registration key file.(duh!)
  5) The key contains user name, user number, checksum
etc.(blablablabla={empty brain})
  6) The key also contains emulation-data that is used by the
program.(What in the heck is this?)
  7) The user name/number are stored at various locations in
executable.(do you make a NO$GBA signed by Hugo Chavez?)
  8) That is parts of as clean ascii, but mostly encrypted
text/numbers.(dekripter=www.thecracks.ws)
  9) The fullversion costs $1000 US minimum for a single user.(THIS IS
ABUSE!, none in the heck, in your "sane brain" may pay this BIG money
quantity. In fact, I can bought you a 10000000000000$ only for buy a
good adhesive for shut your mouth)
  10) That provides that only a few people will get hold of it.(again,
visit cracker's palaces and houses filled with the most fine cracks and
WAREZ-to-go(including winxp w/NO$GBA))
  11) A password is required to install the program on a new
computer.(loco!)

If a fullversion and/or registration key and/or decryption program
should leak from a company into public, the company will not receive any
further updates, and, the cutdown/freeware version will be
discontinued.(yeah, YOU ARE A MORON!)

The freeware version is actually used and appreciated by some hobby
coders, if you crack & kill the program, some gamers will maybe kiss
your ass, the more serious user won't.(YOU NEED TO FILL YOUR ASS WITH
TNT and U-238)
PD:
VisualBoyAdvance in your latest versi&oacute;n incluse some debugging functions
(verbose SWI, ARM, a dissasembler, and complete commercial ROM support.)
You need this:
1)rebuild your site and put a ton o' banners, this like a prison, a old
newspaper (only needs the "yellow old daily"
2)remove the [EOF] from all of your files, including the website and the
readme files
3)buy a REAL gba with tons of games, for avoid this stupid
emulator(NO$GBA, of course)
4)development of a FREE emu
5)learn HTML4, javaScript, and Visual Basic (or MFC)
6)boy a new AthlonXP2000+(Pentium sucks)
7)chat, you need CAHT!
8)http://vboy.emuhq.com
9)http://www.efnet.com
10)http://www.mirc.com
11)http://www.ircap.com (click English)
12)buy FrontPage and take a course with Fabian Feld and Matias Wullich,
in Argentina
13)close your stupid site and move to a free hosting
14)kill your bank account, nobody wants to register your "GBA emulation
SDK Enterprise Editon" $1000+a kick in your ass (good name)
15)Get a life, you need sex and a girlfriend!
16)ASSEMBLER SUX!
17)Learn LogoWriter
18)10000 flexions
19)http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/
20)The suicinde (:x you need to get a REAL life or death!
21)irc.rt.ru #GBANOW !list
22)You can make Sega emulators, the world need new Genesis emulatoes
23)Cable TV, and watch "Top Cat" in Cartoon Network
24)You need a vacations: to Venezuela (pop=25000000) or to
AssemblerLandia (in the hell, pop=you)
25)Finally, GOTO 0

Please remove your site. It's dumb and useless. You seem like one of
those cross nerds...and you are. Maybe you should spend more time

To the emulation community, charging $1000+ just so that people can use an
emulator you made in your spare time. If you want to rip people off, why dont
you go work for Microsoft or something, maybe then you could get away with
charging extortionate prices for a tool thats useless to most people
interested in emulation.

hey man, at least one cracked version appeared, and you DISCONTINUES the
free (and fucked) version of you FUCKING M$NO$GBA.

you need to search work at microsoft, buy a new computer with Window$ XP,
learn Linux and C++, and test VisualBoyAdvance (100% OPEN SOURCE, 100% FREE,
and 1000% more utility than your fucking emulator.

MUGS cracks fucks too, i have their Pokemon for GBA cracks, and it fucks
(CLOCK WORKING, bah!!!, it no need a crack since VBA 1.5, released
yesterday, supports RTC!!!). i agree with you in that point. MUGS CRACKS
SUCKS, but YOU SUCKS TOO

discontinue a version is a BIG stupidity. For a example: Millons of people
use Winzip false regkeys, but Nico Mak Computing stills producing and
supporting that program (the regkey algorythm used is released in 1995,
since the 5.xx version, and it no changed., and now is the 2003.)

your ass-lamer programs are the shame of the world programmers community.
This program creates a new type of shareware: NO$Ware=fucking low-quality
software, existing third-party free and better solutions.

If you need some money, you need to get a life, get a job in Micro$oft. With
this Iraq war, and the global recession of the economy, nobody have too much
money to buy software.

This is the cost of a modern PC
500$    clone customized-PC
1$        Window$ pirate or Linux disk
5$        pirated sofware
10$      internet connection for dowload cracks, keygens and WAREZ
0$        register software
---------------------
including taxes= 550$. (a good-OEM pc with OEM-original-windoze costs about
1000$, and it costs your fucking 250-kbyte emulator, about 4$ per kilobyte,
a big steal).

or if you REALLY need money, consider steal a bank, and spend 10-20 years in
a mental-hospital. your money needs is a fatal obssesion that you needs to
beat.
