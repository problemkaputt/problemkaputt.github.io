<B>Please read first</B><BR>
Before reading below, please note that <B>I still do accept money</B> for
no$gmb (and of course, still send out reg keys in reply).
As explained below, I have mostly discontinued working on no$gmb (except
eventually for a few bug fixes here and and there, and except for some
improvements to the nocash user interface in general, which no$gmb may
indirectly benefit from either).<BR>
Also, I have tried to make no$gmb as perfect as possible, and even the older
versions have been of quite good quality, and the program got improved by
each further update, and even though I've stopped to add further 'final
details', the current version <I>is</I> a useful good program, and it's worth
even a bit more than the requested 5 dollars. So, if you want to use it, then
please buy a registration key rather than stealing it!<P>
<B>Newer nocash projects</B><BR>
After giving up gameboy stuff I've turned back to improving my old
CPC and MSX emulators (which probably almost nobody wants to use, and thus
nobody would attempt to steal them either, and which are freeware anyways),
wrote an email client/program (not released/completed yet), started two new
emulators for ZX81 and C64 (parts of not released/completed yet either).<BR>
And - rather unwillingly, but after all needing some money - turned back to
living/modern consoles and started a GBA emulator, which will be available
to commercial developers only (not wanting to get through that pirates
stealing the program rather than paying a handful of dollars stuff another
time, sorry). However, a cutdown/freeware version will be kept available for
'hobby' programmers - after all, I am happy about all old school programmers
whom are still writing handcrafted machine code, and/or kids whom are
teaching themselves assembler programming - even though the overpowered 32bit
GBA CPU probably gets intruded by c++ programming students as well :-/

Nocash Unwanted Persons
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
<B>What's this?</B><BR>
This is a list of persons whom are distributing stolen no$gmb registration keys,
whom have cracked no$gmb, and/or whom have faked reg keys. The program contained
a couple of years of highly motivated work, and has been kept available for a
rather decent and uncommercial registration fee of only 5 dollars. The persons
listed below decided to make the program available for free, and have scattered
my motivations and more or less killed the program.<P>

<P>
Asides from this mere handful of people (and probably thousands of others whom
are using and re-distribting the cracks), a lot of no$gmb users have given me
the feeling that they'd love my work, and from what I know many of them have
tried to convince pirates not to touch the program. Alltogether I've been
happy about all that good people - until various pirates suddenly started a
massive attack against the windows version 2.4 update, initiated by the Utopia
crew in February 2000. After the second wave against version 2.5, all motivation
got replaced by frustation, and I've quickly shut down my gameboy programming
efforts from 24hours/day at 7days/week, to somewhat 2hours/month, and more or
less avoided even to think about the unlucky program for about one year.

"Ghostcow" reg key
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
This is been the first stolen reg key that leaked into the net. The guy who had
registered the key alltogether sounded like honest & friendly boy, saying that
his grandmother is carrying the letter to the mailbox for him, and I've even
trusted him so much that I did send the key before actually receiving his
money (which, at least, actually reached me some days later).<BR>
However, the key leaked out, maybe he's been uploading it by himself, maybe
somebody silently stole it from his computer, maybe he believed that it wouldn't
be harmful if he'd "exchange" it against another reg key from somebody
else...<BR>
Anyways, at that time I just hoped that this wouldn't happen again, locked out
the key in future updates, and actually didn't got bothered by pirates during
the next some no$gmb versions (except for about a dozen of thiefs whom
complained that "their" ghostcow key wouldn't work woth newer no$gmb versions,
or, in some cases slightly modified ghostcow keys; v2.1 didn't actually verify
the existing key checksums, so it's been easy to modify until v2.2 which
rejected both modified and/or stolen keys).

Utopia / Ed Hunter
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
This is the first real crack, released a few days after I've uploaded the first
windows version. No$gmb for window's been mostly made to support lamers, parts
off hoping to get some extra money, practically, it's been just focusing the
interest of teenage software pirates onto the program. Apparently, DOS users
are more honest persons, and/or windows lamers simply don't know how to use
a DOS program.<BR>
Reportedly, Utoptia is a cracking group that is mainly based in canada and/or
germany (or elsewhere?). The crack got shipped with crackers email address
<A HREF="mailto:lUKULLUS@uSA.nET">lUKULLUS@uSA.nET</A>, the lukullus person
is reportedly operating under the pseudonym &lt;Curlin&gt; at US EFnet, also, a couple
of weeks later I've received an email from "Eddy Smurf"
<A HREF="mailto:smurfeddy@hotmail.com">smurfeddy@hotmail.com</A> whom claimed
to be a member of the utopia crew, and whom claimed to be sorry about the
crack, kinda late though.<P>

Ninetales / Morris M.
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
This is just a lamer that has somewhere sneaked a registration key from
a registered user, almost simultaneously to the Utopia crack.
Morris is operating a webpage, mainly containing pirated
pokemon cartridges to be played with no$gmb + stolen reg key, the webpage is
apparently designed for 1000 dollars/21" super color monitor only, nevertheless,
I've managed to decipher some of the text; among others it contains a disclaimer
that informs users that piracy is illegal and that states himself not to be
responsible for his actions - which I still don't fully understand - eventually
he wants to indicate that he's a total dumbass - and in so far not
intentionally responsible...<BR>
In that matter, Morris is forever thankful about any persons whom pay
attention to him, and when emailing him at
<A HREF="mailto:ninetales9@metconnect.com">ninetales9@metconnect.com</A> he'll
be more than happy to confirm his identiy and mailing address: <I>Morris Massry,
1914 East 28 Street, Brooklyn, New York (NY), 11229.</I>

Faked MIO$ reg key
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
Very little known about this one, it came out along with the Utopia/Ninetales
attacks, there's been no name/pseudonym included, the author has called his
unpleasant work "MIO$" instead of "NO$"-registration key. Considering that he
has chosen to fake a registration key rather than acually cracking the
executable, he might (or might not) be related to the 'UCF' crack for no$gmb
v2.5.

UCF crack
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
The first illegal copy of no$gmb v2.5, consisting of a parts of
cracked/modified executable, and a parts of functional faked reg key,
which is simulating a 'golden' registration key (ie. one for special friends,
but otherwise just working as normal keys).<BR>
The reg key contains some waffling about UCF, eventually indicating that it's
been cracked by a UCF member, from what I've found out UCF is a several years
old german crackers group, somewhat called Ultimate Crackers Foundation (or
similiar, don't know).<BR>
Similiar as for the Utopia crack, I got an email from somebody who claimed to
know the UCF members, forwarding some text to me that they'd be so sorry and
blah, blah. Btw. in order to prevent people from doing something which they
might regret at later time, version 2.5 contained a warning message that
informed crackers that I don't want the program to be cracked, and that I'd
discontinue the program otherwise (that message showed up once when modifying
the exefile).

"Ken Reilly" Reg key
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
Now this one is parts of been my own fault, a couple of months ago I had
received an email from somebody called Ken Reilly who claimed to have send
$20 which have never arrived here though. Well, I've been a bit suspicious,
especially about the big amout (most people whom have <I>actually</I> sent money
usually have send only 2 or 5 dollars at that time), but he promised to have
sent it, and so he got a key for free - which later turned out to be a
timebomb and got released in the net after uploading no$gmb v2.5.<BR>
Not totally sure if Ken intentionally spreaded the key, or if it got stolen
from him without his knowledge, the confusing part is that he has sent an
email trying to help to identify Utopia (by logging on to something called
'mirc', something about chatting, as far as I know) before his own key leaked
out. But aside from this anti-piracy-style email, it's not very likely that
<I>both</I> his money <I>and</I> his reg key mysteriously got stolen from him -
in either case, say it's been laziness, bad luck, or criminal energy, better
be careful about this person...

Jlpicard / D N G R S B B C
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
This person doesn't exactly match into this document, as he isn't himself
cracking the program or newly stealing reg keys, instead, he is just
re-distributing existing cracks/keys. However, he's been actively attacking
me (and apparently dozens of other shareware authors) for a very long time.
Also, when I have had a look at his webpage, it seemed that he is actually
making money with piracy - the page contained two commercial advertising
banners, one probably belonging to his provider, and the other one to
himself.<BR>
Firstly, he spreaded a Ghostcow key for no$gmb v2.1, and as I got told, the
'gameboy community' stopped talking to him at that time, leading him to remove
they stolen key from his webpage again, and, as there's still nobody wanting to
talk to him (which I can easily understand), he re-uploaded the key again.
Finally, about one year later he confirmed to be a very unpleasant person by
spreading the UCF crack as well.

"Daniel Moxon" Reg key
</TD></TR></TABLE><P>
Even though there have been already three cracked/stolen no$gmb versions
released directly after uploading no$gmb v2.5, a couple of months later a
further stolen reg key leaked out (working with 2.5 as well, and belonging
to somebody using the name "Daniel Moxon").
Now at that time, the program's been already killed anyways, and in so far
this late attack didn't actually hurt very much, and it merely confirmed that
there's always somebody whom wants to fuck you up.
