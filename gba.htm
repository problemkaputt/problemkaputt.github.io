<B>Supporting the no$gba project</B><BR><FONT SIZE=-1>
If somebody would like to help me on the nocash project, here's a list of
some things that'd be useful to me, for research purposes:<BR>
 - broken/older DSi DMW-W015 wifi board (for desoldering wifi chips and tracing PCB wires)<BR>
 - broken NDS/DSi/3DS consoles or mainboards (for desoldering and PCB tracing)<BR>
 - newer DSi console (with DWM-W024 wifi board)<BR>
 - 3DS or 2DS consoles (not New3DS, already got one)<BR>
 - 1-3 spare SDmicro adapters (for making custum cables to easy testing)<BR>
 - 1-2 old MMC cards (for testing compatibility with non-SD cards)<BR>
 - windows xp, english version (cdrom and licence/sticker)<BR>
 - gba infra-red adapter<BR>
 - gba wifi adapter<BR>
 - bug reports (detailed info please: say what does not work in which situations)<BR>
Monetary <A HREF="donate.htm">donations</A> are also valuable support (I have no other income and need to eat, drink, smoke, work, and sleep somewhere, your support can make all that things possible).

 <B>Freeware/donations</B><BR>
 No$gba is now fully freeware. Optional <A HREF="donate.htm">donations</A>
 would be very <B>welcome</B> and <B>valuable</B> support for continuing the
 <A HREF="index.htm">no$xxx</A> projects.
 <BR>
 In general, I am aiming at living with little money, and to work just for
 the fun it. However, in the past two years I ended up with too less money -
 which isn't really fun - I needed to borrow some money, and currently, a bag
 of coffee can appear like a big investment (I can still buy coffee, but doing
 so is making me feel uncomfortable, it's different from past years of big ease,
 where I would have bought such goods without second thought).
 <BR>
 Not to mention the evil end-of-the-month: Without real job and without
 regular income, it's the day when I need to pay the rent - without getting
 any money (unless I am lucky and some people have gratefully donated
 something).
 <BR>
 With donations you could really help me.
 But nevermind, no problem if you don't like to, or if you can't do so.

<B>Questions on how to use no$gba</B><BR>
Please send any questions on how to use the freeware version to a <A HREF="http://ngemu.com/forums/no-gba-discussion.102/">Forum</A>. Hoping that other users can help you.<BR>
Non-technical bug reports, eg. <I>"Princess Piggy can't fly in Level 3 of Animal Dreams IV"</I>, that information isn't useful to me, please go post it to a <A HREF="http://ngemu.com/forums/no-gba-discussion.102/">Forum</A> or tell it to somebody else.<BR>
Technical bug reports, eg. <I>"no$gba crashes on MOV R0,R7 opcodes on ARM7 CPU in NDS mode"</I>, that would be very interesting, please let me know about that things per email!<BR>

DSi emulation booting - finally (8 months work to get there)<BR>
note: doing this on your computer will require several system files (which you probably don't have) (see DSi Emulation chapter in no$gba help for details)<BR>

DSi mainboard signals, <A HREF="twl-core.jpg">see more</A> (the photos are
from neimod and scanlime, and probing 0 ohm connections with a multimeter
was done on my own mainboard).
About as expected, that project has (almost) completely bricked the console:
After probing the the SMD pins hundreds of times, the solder pads became
deformed, producing shortcuts between pins.
After reassembling the console and half-heartedly cleaning the solder pads,
the first thing happening was blowing the battery fuse. After repairing the
fuse and more cleaning it started working with nearly black screens, cleaning
the backlight pins made it almost working, only the touchscreen and sound
remained non-functional, and the tapping the power button caused white screens
instead of doing a warmboot, which was apparently caused by dirt on one of the
reset pins. Alltogether I've spent several hours on scratching the gaps between
numerous SMD pins with a needle - and now everything seems to be back
working.<BR>
The whole pinout project did take maybe 80 hours, whereas I just want to
connect some wires to the NAND pins. And then I ended up with: Why not making
a component list before modding the PCB? And why not probing the pinouts of
the ribbon cable connectors? And hey, why not spending six more days on
probing the whole chipset pinout?
