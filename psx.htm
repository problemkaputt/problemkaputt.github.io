<B>Donations</B><BR>
No$psx is freeware, <A HREF="donate.htm">donations</A> will be very welcome.

My overall income is near zero, and I am glad about anything, including
small amounts.

You can send money to my bank account, or send bitcoins.
I am banned on paypal (because my webpage is violating all kinds of laws,
they haven't been able to say which laws, but surprisingly they've openly
admitted that they don't accept emulators - reasons might be general
incompetence, and/or their own financial interests, I don't know).

<B>The Program</B> is intended to work out-of-the-box. There is no need for
  specific windows versions, special video drivers, obscure plug-ins,
  virtual CDROM drives, system BIOS, or tweaked per-game configurations.<BR>
<B>The Emulation</B> should be complete with all hardware features fully
  implemented and working, though as by now it wasn't tested with too many
  games, so there may be still some problems with other games (bug reports
  are welcome).<BR>
<B>The BIOS</B> is emulated via a BIOS-clone, which is free and faster than the
  original PSX-BIOS. There may be still some compatibilty issues (especially as
  most PSX games are applying patches to the original BIOS; the BIOS clone is
  reproducing known patches, but may fail on unknown ones). In case of problems,
  please use a copy of the original BIOS (with filename PSX-BIOS.ROM in no$psx
  folder), and please let me know if that is fixing problems with any games.<BR>
<B>CDROMs</B> are supported via complete disk images (in
  .CCD+IMG,
  .CDI,
  .CUE+BIN,
  .MDS+MDF,
  or .NRG format),
  via single-track images (.ISO files), or as raw executables (.EXE files).
  Decompressing .ECM and .CDZ files is supported.
  Subchannel data (for libcrypt'ed games) can be read from .SBI, .M3S, .SUB, .MDF files.
  Reading from real CDROM drives is also supported, but does require
  wnaspi32.dll (which appears to be a problem on WinNT/Win2K and higher).<BR>
<B>Minimum Requirements</B> are around 1-2 GHz on a Pentium 3,
  which is maybe fast or maybe not so fast
  (older PSX emulators are said to be working on 200MHz computers,
  on the other hand, I got told that no$psx is much faster than those
  old emulators... I've no clue how that is possible).<BR>
<B>Debugging/Development</B> functions include disassembler, debugger, profiler,
  code breakpoints, memory breakpoints, assembler, I/O map viewer, VRAM viewer,
  polygon viewer, TTY debug console window, and complete PSX hardware specs.<BR>
<B>Pocketstation</B> is emulated as part of <A HREF="gba.htm">no$gba</A>
  v2.7 and up (the pocketstation is a PSX memory card with LCD screen; emulated
  in no$gba because GBA and pocketstation are both based on ARM processors).<BR>

<B>Hardware Donations</B><BR>
If you've some old PSX hardware that you want to get rid off, and that youwant to donate for emulation and research purposes, some things that I amlooking for would be:
<LI>PS2 Gamepad (for testing PS2 controller)</LI>
<LI>SCPH-1040 Serial Link Cable (for testing max transfer rate; which is needed since games seem to autodetect that max rate)</LI>
<LI>SCPH-10180 I-Mode adaptor, and maybe an old I-Mode compatible mobile phone</LI>
<LI>SLEH-0005/SLUH-00017 Konami Lightgun (for testing if it's accuracy is really worse than Guncon)</LI>
<LI>SLPH-00100/SLUS-00063 Fishing Controller (ascii/agetec)</LI>
<LI>BANC-0001 Fishing Controller (Bandai)</LI>
<LI>HPS-97/HPS-98 Fishing Controller with attached plastic fish (Hori)</LI>
<LI>SCPH-1150 old analog joypad (with one vibration motor, with red/green led)</LI>
<LI>SCPH-1180 old analog joypad (without vibration motors, with red/green led)</LI>
<BR>Note: shipping address would be in germany.
