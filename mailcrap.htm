Here's a compilation of some emails, picked more or less randomly from my
mail folders. Maybe it's interesting to read them, and it should explain
why I've first encoded my email address into hex-format (<FONT SIZE=-2>6E 6F
63 61 73 68 40 77 6F 72 6B 2E 64 65</FONT>), and then (as that didn't help much)
completely gave up the nocash@work.de address, and got myself a new non-public
address which isn't listed in the readme, help text, webpage, or elsewhere.
</TD><TD WIDTH=5%></TD><TD WIDTH=45%><FONT SIZE=-1>
That mails quickly became a annoying major problem, I have tried to read
that junk for years, probably lost half of my brain and hundreds of important
mails among that garbage, and silently cursed those idiots. On the other hand,
most of them probably didn't knew how much I did suffer under their 'harmless'
questions, and most are probably just children whom asked for help.

Well, I am completly tortured, but not really angry. To avoid that somebody
else reads the messages below and sends spam or angry mails to that guys I've
overwritten all names and email addresses, but beside for that I didn't
change the message content, it's not censored, and contains 100% authentic
bullshit, read on own risk!

Martin Korth,
I registered your product at the start of the year. Just today a went to
your site and downloaded the newest version. But when I go into your program
it says that it is an illegal or damaged registration key. I have attached
my key as it says in the readme file (readme.txt). I have NOT obtained this
key illegally. I hope you can fix my problem.
