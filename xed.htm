<FONT SIZE=+1><A NAME="XED"></A>XED nocash text / ascii editor</FONT><P>
Todays editors suck memory. The character output is very slow.
I hate them.
<BR>Many people use their computers as better type-writers.
I wanted to do so, too.
<BR>For years I dreamt of Word Star for PC. And as I got it, it didn't
work with files >64K. Bingo.
<BR>Other editors didn't support simple word-wrap. Or they were overkilled by
wysiwyg and senseless slowdown and memory-sucking stuff.
<BR>I never accepted them, waited for something called comfortable type-writer.
<BR>Finally I wrote XED.
