<B>Before release</B><BR>
My first experience with the SNES has been in 1999, when I received a SNES
and a SGB, donated from Boris "bs" Schneider for researching SGB-related
things for my Gameboy emulator.
Some years later, in November 2006, I digged out that old SNES,
and actually started working on SNES emulation. The sequential access feature
of the WRAM chip made it extremly easy to upload test programs to the SNES
via simple parallel port cable.
And, at first glance, the 65C816 CPU looked simple: just some subtle
differences between real 6502, 65C816 in 6502 mode, 65C816 in 8bit mode, and
65C816 in 16bit modes, so I could just customize my 6502 emulation code...
Well, that subtle differences summed up, so after soon, I abandoned that idea,
and decided to write a new 65C816 core (almost) from scratch up.
The other problem back then has been a frustating lack of PPU/APU documention,
the existing docs have been extremely incomplete and many sentences sounded
like incorrect japanese-to-english translations (although, I think they were
typed-up from Nintendo's official english specs - which makes me wondering
how western companies ever managed to produce SNES games).
Anyways, after a handful of months, I gave up, and dropped the no$sns project.
Finally, in October 2010, I discovered Anomie's great docs, explaining
everthing including glitches about the PPU/APU in "real" english. This time,
nothing could stop me, and I continued working full-time until finally
releasing no$sns - I got a bit trapped by the add-ons, so, after all it took
until February 2012.
