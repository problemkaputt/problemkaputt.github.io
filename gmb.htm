<A NAME="ABOUT"><B><U>ABOUT NO$GMB</U></B></A><P>
No$gmb is a emulator for gameboy, pocket gameboy, super gameboy, and color
gameboy, allowing you to play any gameboy game on your PC, provided that
you own a romimage of that game (a copy of the program in the real cartridge).
Note that these games are usually copyrighted, except for a few freeware ones.
<P>
Beside for the ability to play games it does also include a <B>debugger</B>
with graphics user interface, conditional breakpoints, symbolic debug
information, VRAM viewer, optional warning messages, online assembler, and
various other useful things, making it a powerful development tool that is
used by several professional game developers.
<P>
Further features are emulation of two player link (on the same computer),
screenshots, real CGB-colors, gamegenie and gameshark cheats, joysticks,
snespads, digital sound, a color scheme editor to colorize monochrome games,
etc. etc.
<P>
The program is entirely written in assembler language, which makes it fast
enough to run on older computers, for monochrome games a 386 with at least
33Mhz should be suggested, and for color games a 486 with something like 66Mhz.
<P>

<A NAME="DOWNLOAD"><P><B><U>DOWNLOADING NO$GMB</U></B></A><P>
Below are a couple of different versions. The Windows version is for Windows
95/98/NT/2000, it requires a rather fast computer (at least 66MHz suggested),
it is including a typical windows user interface (new in this version), and it
is probably easier to install, and more compatible to newer windows versions.
The Standard DOS version is including mostly the same features, but of course
it is a lot faster.<P>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmb.zip">Standard 32bit Windows version</A> - suggested for windows users with fast computers<BR>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmbd.zip">Standard DOS version</A> - suggested for DOS users with at least traces of a brain<P>
For people with older computers, here are some special versions,
timing-optimized for the specific CPUs, note that these versions are
<I>excluding</I> a few rather time-consuming debugging functions.<P>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmb4.zip">Special DOS 80486 optimized version</A> - a bit faster, but not including all debugging functions<BR>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmb3.zip">Special DOS 80386 optimized version</A> - a bit faster, but not including all debugging functions<BR>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmb0.zip">Special DOS XT/AT compatible version</A> - a bit slower, and not  including all debugging functions<P>
And finally here is a LITE version. It excludes all debugging functions, I
made this version just for fun, and it doesn't have any advantages over the
other versions. As it doesn't reflect the full capabilities of the program I
don't want this version to get more public than the other versions, for this
reason the lite version is for registered users only - it won't work without
registration key.<P>
  Download <A HREF="no$gmbl.zip">Special DOS LITE version</A> - for registered users only, not including any debugging functions<P>
All versions are sized less than 150 KBytes each.

The old (monochrome) gameboy emulation, and the Super Gameboy features are
freeware, and do not need to be registered, but the color gameboy emulation
part is shareware. Please understand that I need to ask for some money, after
all I have put about three years of work into the program, and thus didn't had
time to work on something else. So, your money is very welcome, and will help
me to continue to work on no$gmb!
<P>
New currency <A HREF="euro.htm">VERY IMPORTANT EURO INFORMATION - CLICK HERE</A> read this!
<P>
For private, non-commercial use please register by sending an amount in range
from $5 to $20 (whatever you prefer) (or similiar amount in other currency) to
my <A HREF="address.htm">mailing address</A>. Please also include your <I>name,
address, and email address,</I> preferably written in your best handwriting (or
printed in case that you own a printer).
For <U>commercial</U> use the registration fee is $750 US (that is if you are
a game developer for example).
<P>
The postage fee for airmail from USA appears to be 60 cents, ask your post
office if you want to be sure. It should take around one or two weeks until
the letter arrives here and I get the key sent to you (per email). The
registration key will be valid for all no$gmb versions, including future
updates. If you have <U>further questions</U> regarding registration, please
