<B>VERY IMPORTANT EURO INFORMATION</B>
<P>
The german currency changes from german marks (DM) into euro (EUR) at
1st January 2002. During the time from 1st January through 28 February 2002
I will keep accepting both DM and/or EUR, except that DM cannot be accepted
from 15th Feb-28th Feb (postage stamp date), also, EUR cannot be accepted
during 5th Jan-17th Jan (postage stamp date), during the time from 30th
Jan-3rd Feb (delivery date!) neither DM nor EUR are accepted and US$ must be
send instead, and during 1st Feb-18 Feb (postage stamp date); at 4:00 PM-5:00 PM
(myself checking the mailbox time) only crowns or gulden will be accepted.
<P>

Because of technical reasons, your money will be destroyed and I cannot
send a registration key if you are sending the wrong money at the wrong time!
</B>
<P>
When sending euros, the registration order forms which do not correctly
specify the euro currency symbol will be ignored, that means, the order
form MUST include the "[--not recognized character code(ISO1432.238) --
this computer does not support japanese and korean fonts--]" symbol.

Okay, here's some additional information, I'll accept whatever currency you
send, if it's Euro would be fine, if it's money from an non-Euro country
(eg. USA, canada, japan, UK, and the whole rest of the world) would be fine
either.
<P>
If you still have "old" money (from Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Irland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, or Spain) -
send that before somewhat mid February 2002, if possible (at a later time
I might have problems to change it into "new" money).
<P>
Asides, this is your 'last chance' to get rid of the olde cash!<BR>
[Ah, but please no foreign coins - my bank office changes paper money only.]
