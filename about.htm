<B>Curious info about my Fantastic Career and Forthcoming Empire</B>
<P>
I have been born in Hamburg, Germany at 3rd June 1972, grew up, and still
living in Hamburg. Learned programming from my father, quitted school when
I have been around 20 years old, teached myself more about computers, and
spent some time on inactivity, on civil services, and more inactivity.
<P>
Then got bored about computers and inactivity, and visited a school for
kindergarden teachers instead. Unfortunately that's been mostly theoretical
stuff, they didn't even show us at least pictures of children. After one
and a half year of underlining words, and discussing these words with my
neighbours, I decided to stay in bed and to quit school again.
<P>
Well, at that time I had sold no$gmb registration keys to the first
commercial users, allowing me to survive without money from my parents,
and without having to care for a 'real' job. The downside about programming
at home is that you sometimes loose most social contacts, and if you get
paid for it then it's even more comfortable to get trapped...
<P>
Uh, I hope I find a better way to manage my spare time (if any) sooner or
later, preferably soon. At the moment I am looking for a new flat in
Hamburg, and and everyting will get better when I found it (hopefully). The
problem is that I'd love to live in a quarter that appears to have established
itself as mainstream quarter, so the few unoccupied flats in that area are
either too expensive, or get rent to people with 'real' jobs.
<P>
<B>The Nocash Concept</B>
<P>
Well, I did choose this possibly silly pseudonym a couple of years ago, but
alltogether it still represents my lifestyle quite good. Nocash is meant as a
statement against consum and luxory.
<P>
In case of computers that means that I am partly amused, and partly worried
about the craze for newer and faster computers, and for more bloated and
inefficent programs. And the people <I>really</I> believe that they would
need the hitrash stuff. I mean, give list of five million numbers to one of
these guys, and tell him to add all that numbers together, how long would that
take? One week? A month? But he would still treat a computer that handles that
calculations within a single second as 'slow'.
<P>
In my programs I attempt to point out that the quality of a program doesn't
depend on it's size, or on the hardware. Yes, yes, that might be a senseless
attempt, but I like it that way.
