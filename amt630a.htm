<B>AMT630A</B><BR>
The AMT640A is a relative common video controller chip found in cheap
mini TFT screens with composite input.<BR>
Those screens are often sold as "car rear view monitor" (or by similar names),
although they are essentially fully-fledged portable TVs (minus tuner/speaker,
and without advanced inputs like S-video or RGB).<BR>
The chip contains a 8031/8051 microprocessor, with firmware stored on an
external SPI-bus FLASH memory chip.
<P>
Theoretically, it could be used as miniture monitor for gaming consoles.
Unfortunately, it's working rather disappointing in practice:<BR>
<LI>(fixed) original firmware has Backlight is at max brightness and cannot be changed.</LI>
<LI>(fixed) original firmware doesn't recognite C64 video signals.</LI>
<LI>(fixed) original firmware is having GUI annoying timeouts.</LI>
<LI>(fixed) original firmware doesn't support proper power-saving in standby mode.</LI>
<LI>(more or less fixed) PAL60 produces wrong colors.</LI>
<LI>(more or less fixed) PAL60 forgets to update some scanlines (and draws wrong/older lines).</LI>
<LI>With 320x240 pix screen, resampling is smeared, possibly a bit uglier than required...
  <LI>For NTSC, one could theoretically leave blank lines (with black borders)</LI>
  <LI>For PAL, one could theoretically crop lines (eg. on homecomputers with 200 lines)</LI>
  </LI>
<LI>Display seems to have some vertical-interlace-style flickering (even on non-interlaced pictures) (not sure if that's caused by the display or by scanline resampling).
<P>
Most of that issues are firmware related, so I've spent 2-3 weeks on
disassembling it, and a bunch of more weeks on making my own firmware:<BR>
<A HREF="amt630a.zip">new custom AMT630A firmware</A> (109Kbytes) (includes several improvements, some hardware diagnostics tool, and <A HREF="magicflr.htm">magic floor</A> game)<BR>
<A HREF="engels.zip">original AMT630A firmware disassembly</A> (256Kbytes) (includes a mess of HLL coded stuff)<BR>
The source code (and also the disassembly) can be re-assembled
via <A HREF="x51.htm">no$x51</A>. Rev-engineered AMT630A hardware specs can be also found on the no$x51 page.<P>
Currently supported display types:
<LI>Tianma 3.5" 320x240 (4:3) (tested/working)</LI>
<LI>Noname 3.5" 320x240 (4:3) (not tested, but should work)</LI>
<LI>Innolux 4.3" 480x272 (16:9) (not tested, but should work)</LI>
<LI>Innolux 5.0" 480x272 (16:9) (not tested, but should work)</LI>
<P>
I would be also interested in dumps from other firmware versions...
<LI>firmware for screens with other resolutions</LI>
<LI>firmware with RC-5 infrared IR input support or I2C support</LI>
<LI>firmware with volume control support</LI>
<LI>AMT630 firmware (to see if it's similar/compatible to AMT630A)</LI>
<LI>other older/newer firmware revisions</LI>
<LI>etc.</LI>
<BR>
That stuff would help on finding which I/O ports have which functions (eg. for changing the screen resolution/resampling).

<BR>Photos showing the original 3.5inch display comes in black/silver case with dangling cables, and rather unfortunate 16:9 form factor despite of the nice small 4:3 display, and my own case with true 4:3 form factor & rear connectors.
