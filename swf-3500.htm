SWF-3500 Super Woofer</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

The Super Woofer is a neat black ghettoblaster in a beautiful black case
with a lot of square and some diagonal edges, manufactured in 1988 according
to the chip markings. One day, I found the Super Woofer on my staircase, asked
the neighbors where it came from, and got told that it's trash and that I can
have it. It wasn't trash, worked perfectly without even eating my tapes.
People who grew up with silver zeppelin shaped CD players may not like it.
Anyways about everybody who grew up in the eighties and sees it says:
Wow, that's cool.
<P>
Since I didn't find a schematic or service manual, here're the results of
my own research, with some potentially useful notes, pin-outs, and testpoints...

<P><B>Rubber-Wheel and Drive Belts</B><BR>
The first thing I noticed when I got my SWF was that one the drives did
have the small rubber wheel missing; anyways, I found it inside of the
case, and justed needed to snap it back in.<BR>
As in all tape drives, drive belts tend to get worn-out after 10 years or
so, causing the drive to spin slowly, or even to eat the tape. In my SWF,
the belts are still okay (maybe they were already replaced some years ago),
anyways, in case of problems it may be a good idea to buy some new belts.

<P><B>Contacts</B><BR>
Next, the volume and equalizer regulators produced ugly scratch noise when
touching them, which I got fixed with some evil contact spray. It may be
also good to put some spray on the various switches; When I tried to measure
the Tuner/AUX/Tape contacts, I found only one 0 ohm contact, on the other
contacts I measured absurde values like 20 kilo-ohms (although the switches
still worked somehow). After some days the Deck-B output volume became
extremly silent and muffled, after putting some spray on the Play/Record
switch (S3) it seems to be working again (altough the problem may have been
caused by something else, that days the room-temperature dropped to 12'C, so
maybe the super woofer just got a cold).

<P><B>Plastic Clips</B><BR>
There are some elastic plastic clips that seem to tend to break: Two rather
unimportant clips that stabilize the big carrying handle in its vertical
position. And, four rather important ones:
Inside of each drive door, there seem to have been two plastic clips that
pushed-down the cassettes, but all of them seem to have been broken long ago.
In result, inserting tapes feels a bit as if the cassettes are a good bit too
small for the huge drive opening. And, during operation, the cassettes are
held down only by gravity... which is more at less working okay, but, if
gravity doesn't do it's job, then the tape isn't wound-up properly, and the
drive tends to eat the tape (eg. when turning the drive top-down, or when the
cassette isn't well inserted). So it may be recommeded to remove the drive
doors, and install some new plastic or metal clips inside of them.

<P><B>White Noise Problem...?</B><BR>
In my SWF, I am having some white noise on Deck-B, it's mainly audible when
the tape is stopped (or even when no tape is inserted) (during playback, the
music is louder than the noise, so it isn't too annoying although the noise
is still there).<BR>
The noise disappers when Deck-B is deactivated (eg. when pressing Play/FF/Rew
on Deck-A). Aside from the noise problem, my Deck-B produces slightly deeper
sounds as than playing the same tape in Deck-A (of which, Deck-A tendencially
sounds better).<BR>
I am not sure if there's something broken in my SWF, or if that problem
appears to all SWFs - would be nice to know if it appears in other super
woofers, too!

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

<P><B>AC Power Switch/Power Light</B><BR>
The original "power" switch in the SWF merely switches the 15V off (or
the 12V when using batteries), but keeps the transformator powered at 230V,
so it's permanently wasting a few watts of energy. To the worst, the SWF
doesn't have a Power LED, so it's easy to forget to switch off even the DC
part, and so, to waste a good bunch of watts.<BR>
To fix that problem, I've installed a nice red 230V switch with built-in
power lamp in the rear-plate.

<P><B>Less messy Wires</B><BR>
If you want to do any repairs, you'll probably curse the nasty wires. With
some efforts, the interiors can be made accessible in a more comfortable way:<BR>
  - add a 6pin plug/socket in the wires that go to the rear-plate<BR>
  - add a 8pin plug/socket in the wires that go to the front-plate<BR>
  - replace W10,W11,W12 by longer wires<BR>
  - add 2 contacts for injecting 12V and GND on the mainboard<BR>
For testing, it's best to remove the front-plate and rear-plate completely; the
12V/GND supply voltage can be injected from another external power-supply, and
audio-output can be tested via headphone socket, so the transformator and
speakers aren't needed at all.

Tape Drives</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

The dual-tape deck is pretty straight ahead, without any ferro/chrome/metal
detectors (there's only a record-lock detector), without auto-reverse,
and any without dolby noise reduction, but with Hi-speed dubbing.
And, most important, it's still having real mechanical Play/Stop switches,
so it's just fun to be able to actually <I>press</I> the buttons.

<P><B>Motor and Drive Belts</B><BR>
The dual-deck is having only a single motor shared for both drives, the
advantage is that it's cheap, and eventually ensuring that both drives are
spinning at exactly the same speed when copying one tape to another.

</PRE>
When replacing the belts, they should be arranged as shown above, ie. Belt-A
should be closer to the motor body, and Belt-B closer to the end of the axis.

<P><B>Play/Fast Forward/Rewind</B><BR>
Each deck has a switch that senses when PLAY/FF/REW is pressed. When the
switch on Deck-A is closed, then the output from Deck-B is muted. A rather
strange result is that one cannot rewind a tape in Deck-A while playing
another tape in Deck-B (however, it works vice-versa, rewind in Deck-B, and
play in Deck-A).

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;
Disassembling the Case</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

The case consists of three components: The rear-plate, top-panel, and front.

<P><B>REAR-PLATE</B><BR>
Can be removed by loosening 6 long and 4 short screws.
The rear-plate contains the AC socket, the transformator, the battery box,
and the external antennae. The AC socket also contains a built-in switch that
activates the battery supply when the AC cable is disconnected.

<P><B>TOP-PANEL</B><BR>
The top panel isn't attached by any screws nor snap-ins. Once when the
rear-plate is removed, the top panel can be simply removed by pulling it to
towards the rear side; there's some soft/sticky glue (no hardenend glue) at
the front-end of the top panel, but that can be loosened quite easily.
The top panel contains the main electronics: The tape drivers, the 3 circuit
boards; cassette, tuner, equalizer, etc.

<P><B>FRONT-PANEL</B><BR>
Consists of the front plate (and side/bottom walls), and contains the
speakers: One set of large/tiny speakers (on each side, left and right),
one single bass speaker (in the center), and a microphone (as part of the
right speaker set, ie. underneath of the equalizers).

<P><B>CHANNEL SELECTION MECHANICS</B><BR>
The channel selector unit consists of a large black plastic block with
two large black wheels, located between the Tuner board and Equalizer board.
Underneath of the tuner board is a white lever with notches at both ends of
the lever, which rest on plastic edges inside of the horizontally arranged
wheel.
When removing and re-installing the tuner board: First remove BOTH the tuner
board and channel selector mechanics. Then fit the lever on the wheel, and
attach the tuner board to the mechanics with two screws. Then, attach the
channel mechanics on the equalizer board with another two screws, which can
be reached through holes in the tuner board.

<P><B>Drive Doors</B><BR>
Can be removed easily. Push the two vertical clips inwards that stop the
opened door after reaching the 45 degree positions. The door can be now
lifted up to a 90 degree position, and there it can be removed.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;
CIRCUIT BOARDS</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

The three circuit boards are:

<P><B>Mainboard (CR-X100-02)</B><BR>
Contains the AC-to-DC voltage converter, the audio amplifiers, the tape drive
electronics, and the AUX cinch sockets.

<P><B>Tuner-board (CR-X100-01)</B><BR>
Contains the tuner, and most important: The Tape/Tuner/AUX select switch.

<P><B>Equalizer-board (CR-X100-03)</B><BR>
Contains the equalizer, volume regulator, FMS-Switch and FMS-Led, bass-boost
switch, and the infamous power switch (which is barely a energy wasting
"standby" switch, since it doesn't disconnect the transformator). There's
also a tiny daughterboard with the headphone socket and two resistors on it.

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->
<P><TABLE WIDTH=100%><TR bgcolor="#cccccc"><TD><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;
WIRES</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

The circuit boards (and speakers and rear-plate) are interconnected with a
mess of about 50 single wires (rather than using a handful of flat-cables), to
the worst, the wires are soldered directly from one board to another (without
any plugs/sockets).

The L/R markings for the two AUX-IN wires (W3 and W6) are wrong (left and right
are vice-versa). W26 and W27 are somehow connected as crossed wires (ie. W26
on the mainboard connects to W27 on the tuner board, and W27 to W26).

W6 and W3 are then passed to the Input Select switch.
Mind that L/R are accidently named R/L on the mainboard.

The audio signals are routed somehow like so:
<P>
Drive Head ---&gt; Pre-Amp ---&gt; Input Switch ---&gt; Power Amp's ---&gt; Speakers
<P>
For some reason, each audio input is passed <I>twice</I> to the Input Switch
(not sure, maybe one signal is for recording, and the other for output to the
speakers).<BR>
For speaker output, there are two separate Power Amplifiers, one for normal
left/right speakers (and left/right headphone), and one for the Bass speaker
(used when the Bass Boost switch is on).<BR>
When overloading the 6.8V supply (when dragging 2 Amperes or so), Q5 begins
to smoke. 6.8V isn't always that voltage, another day I've measured 7.4V for
whatever reason.<BR>
