This ascii text file is NO nocash product!<P>
It has been written by Pan of Anthrox, Marat Fayzullin, and Pascal Felber. And finally updated by nocash (therefore it is on this page). Remixed with kOOpA update.<P>
The file itself contains pretty good information about the gameboy IO-ports and helped me as I wrote NO$CPC, actually it was my basic documentation since I had no all-in-one info before. Anyway I HAD MY OWN hackwork, not really complete, but enough to write the infocom interpreter for gameboy...<P>
For sure I mentioned the above authors as I wrote my emulator. So if anyone uses this file to write his own emulator I think he should include their names plus my name somethere in his documentation.<P>
